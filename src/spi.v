/*
 * SPI instruction receiver — ported from the reference mini-TPU spi.v,
 * widened to 16-bit instructions. Receive-only: results are read via
 * STORE instructions on uo_out, so the reference's MISO accumulator
 * readback stream (a 63-bit mux + counter) is omitted to save area on
 * the 1x1 tile.
 *
 * MOSI shifts in on posedge SCLK while CS is low, LSB-first. When the
 * 16th bit lands, the bit counter wraps 15 -> 0; the clk-domain
 * detector turns that wrap into a single-cycle data_ready pulse that
 * presents the instruction to the control unit for exactly one clk
 * cycle (0 = NOP otherwise).
 *
 * Constraint inherited from the reference: SCLK must be much slower
 * than clk (the bit counter crosses into the clk domain unsynchronised;
 * the reference silicon drives SCLK <= clk/6).
